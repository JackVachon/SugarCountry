Leaderboard added:
	* Needs to be centered in CSS. Too tired to figure out how to do it.

v2 additions:
	-leaderboard CSS fixed so status bar no longer goes off screen
	-html divs to add in characters' chosen icons within their HUD
	-Coloring for the Special and 'SUPER' Special tiles (still needs functionality)
	-added a CSS class that can be assigned to whichever player's turn it is
	-Player numbers represented on the board (I figured it'd be way too small to draw
	the players icons onto the game board)
